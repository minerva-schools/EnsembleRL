# Ensemble Reinforcement Learning


This repositeroy presents the code for a three-part series on implementing Ensemble Learning in Cartpole using Q-learning, Deep SARSA, and Deep REINFORCE. 

Briefly, ensemble learning is a method of combining multiple learning models to produce a single, more robust learner. For the purposes of this repository, we employed a simple environment and focus on understanding the learning models and the ensemble logic.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Code 
This repo includes four main jupyter notebooks:

1. A [Deep SARSA](https://github.com/minerva-schools/EnsembleRL/SARSA.ipynb) implementation.
2. A [Q-learning](https://github.com/minerva-schools/EnsembleRL/Q-LEARNING.ipynb) implementation.
3. A [Deep REINFORCE](https://github.com/minerva-schools/EnsembleRL/REINFORCE.ipynb) implementation. See the trained agent [here](https://github.com/minerva-schools/EnsembleRL/model.h5).
4. An [Ensemble learning](https://github.com/minerva-schools/EnsembleRL/Ensemble_RL.ipynb) implementation using the three agents above.

### Tutorials 
A series of tutorials, explaining this code is available on medium.

1. A tutorial on [Deep SARSA](tbd).
2. A tutorial on [Q-learning](tbd).
3. A tutorial on [Deep REINFORCE](tbd).
4. A tutorial on [Ensemble learning](tbd).
